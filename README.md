# E-commerce System Design

## Introduction

In today's rapidly expanding online retail landscape, a robust and efficient e-commerce system is paramount for managing products, customer interactions, shopping experiences, and seamless order fulfillment. This document outlines the design considerations for such a system, focusing on core functionalities from product management to order processing. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the system's fundamental components and their responsibilities, ensuring accurate inventory tracking, streamlined customer workflows, and secure transaction handling.

## Core System Components:

This e-commerce system is architected around four key interconnected components, each encapsulated within a dedicated class:

### 1. Product Management (`Product` Class)

The `Product` class is responsible for the comprehensive management of product listings. This includes:

* **Attributes:** Defining and storing essential product details such as name, price, and stock availability.
* **Inventory Control:** Ensuring accurate tracking of product stock levels.
* **Stock Operations:** Supporting the addition and removal of stock units, as well as updating stock levels based on sales and returns.

### 2. Customer Interaction (`Customer` Class)

The `Customer` class facilitates customer engagement with the system. Key responsibilities include:

* **Identification:** Uniquely identifying each customer by a name or other relevant identifier.
* **Shopping Cart Management:** Maintaining a dedicated shopping cart for each customer to track their selected items.
* **Cart Operations:** Providing functionalities for customers to add and remove products from their shopping cart.

### 3. Shopping Cart Functionality (`ShoppingCart` Class)

The `ShoppingCart` class manages the intricacies of a customer's current selections:

* **Product Selection:** Tracking the products added to the cart and their respective quantities.
* **Cart Manipulation:** Allowing customers to add or remove items from their cart.
* **Discount Application:** Implementing and applying various discount mechanisms to the cart contents.
* **Cost Calculation:** Dynamically calculating the total cost of the items in the cart, including any applied discounts.
* **Summary Provision:** Offering a clear overview of the items currently in the cart and their associated costs.

### 4. Order Processing (`Order` Class)

The `Order` class handles the final stages of the purchasing process:

* **Checkout Management:** Guiding the customer through the checkout procedure.
* **Transaction Handling:** Ensuring secure and successful transaction processing.
* **Stock Finalization:** Updating product stock levels based on completed orders.
* **Order Confirmation:** Generating and confirming order details for the customer.

## Key System Requirements

A well-designed e-commerce system built upon these components should adhere to the following key requirements:

* **Product Data Integrity:** Maintaining accurate and up-to-date information for all listed products.
* **Inventory Accuracy:** Ensuring precise tracking of available stock to prevent overselling and manage inventory effectively.
* **Customer Shopping Experience:** Providing a seamless and intuitive process for browsing, selecting, and managing products in the shopping cart.
* **Discount Flexibility:** Supporting various discount strategies and their accurate application.
* **Secure Transactions:** Implementing secure mechanisms for handling customer payment information and order processing.
* **Stock Level Updates:** Automatically adjusting stock levels upon successful order completion.
* **Order Confirmation:** Providing clear and timely confirmation of completed orders to the customer.

This structured approach to the design and implementation of the e-commerce system will lay the foundation for a robust, scalable, and user-friendly online retail platform.
